# Embedded Systems Experiments

This repository contains 10 hands-on experiments designed for first-year Information Technology students to introduce them to the world of embedded systems. The experiments leverage components like ESP32, ESP32-CAM, and Arduino to perform various tasks such as motor control, smart irrigation, door locks, and more.

These projects are intended to provide a solid foundation in working with sensors and controllers, as well as integrating them into practical applications.
